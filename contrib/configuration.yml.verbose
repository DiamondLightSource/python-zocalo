# Zocalo site configuration file

# This is a YAML formatted configuration file, see for example
# https://getopentest.org/reference/yaml-primer.html if you are not familiar
# with YAML.

# The intention of this file is to contain all site-specific configuration in a
# sufficiently flexible format so that we can remove all configuration from the
# source code. The approach taken in this file is close to the 12-factor best
# practice gold standard (https://12factor.net/config) with a few exceptions.

# This file conforms to v1 of the configuration file specification.
configuration-version: 1

# Most of the entries in a configuration file are plugin configurations.
# They follow the general format
#
#   unique_name:
#     plugin: plugin_name                          # required
#     key: value_that_is_understood_by_the_plugin  # optional
#     ...                                          # optional
#
# Plugins are registered via the zocalo.configuration.plugins entry point.
#

# Configure a logging plugin that forwards log messages to a specific
# graylog endpoint. All of the specifics are handled by the plugin 'graylog',
# which is included in the zocalo package.
graylog-live:
  plugin: graylog
  protocol: UDP
  host: loghost.diamond.ac.uk
  port: 12345

# This is an alternative configuration using the same plugin but with
# different settings.
graylog-alternative:
  plugin: graylog
  protocol: UDP
  host: loghost.diamond.ac.uk
  port: 12346

# Configure a transport mechanism based on stomp. This uses the plugin named
# 'stomp', which is also included with the zocalo package.
stomp-test:
  plugin: stomp
  username: user
  password: 12345
  host: stomp.server.localhost.example.com
  port: 61613
  prefix: zocalo

# Configurations can also be contained in a separate file. These files are read
# on demand only. You can use this to store user credentials in a secure place
# that is only accessible by certain users. File paths can be absolute or
# relative to the referencing configuration file.
stomp-live:
  /path/secrets.yml

# In a deviation to the 12factor model the configuration file groups
# configurations together into environments. You can declare as many
# environments as you like, the names may translate into command line
# parameters, eg. "zocalo.service --live" will start from the 'live'
# configuration, and "zocalo.service --test" from the 'test' configuration.
# Be mindful that names you declare here may therefore collide with command
# line parameters declared elsewhere.
environments:
  live:
    # Each environment definition can contain named elements as well as a
    # generic list of plugins to be initialised in this environment.
    transport: stomp-live
    plugins:
      - graylog-live
  test:
    transport: stomp-test

# The configuration is modular. You can merge additional configuration files
# into this file by listing them under the 'include' key.
# Every file is loaded individually and unconditionally. All files must be
# readable. Each file can have their own 'include:' section where further files
# are included, these recursive includes are loaded in a depth-first manner.
# Included files overwrite transport and plugin definitions in this file.
